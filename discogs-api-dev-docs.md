Here’s your place to code all things Discogs! The Discogs API lets developers
build their own Discogs-powered applications for the web, desktop, and mobile
devices. We hope the API will connect and empower a community of music
lovers around the world!

The Discogs API v2.0 is a RESTful interface to Discogs data. You can access
JSON-formatted information about Database objects such as Artists,
Releases, and Labels. Your application can also manage User Collections
and Wantlists, create Marketplace Listings, and more.

Some Discogs data is made available under the [CC0 No Rights\\
Reserved](http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0) license, and some is
restricted data, as defined in our [API Terms of Use.](https://support.discogs.com/hc/articles/360009334593-API-Terms-of-Use)

Our [monthly data dumps](https://www.discogs.com/data/) are available under
the the CC0 No Rights Reserved license.

If you utilize the Discogs API, you are subject to the [API Terms of Use.](https://support.discogs.com/hc/articles/360009334593-API-Terms-of-Use)
Please also ensure that any application you develop follows the Discogs
[Application Name and Description Policy.](https://www.discogs.com/help/doc/naming-your-application)

* * *

## Quickstart

If you just want to see some results right now, issue this curl command:

```http
curl https://api.discogs.com/releases/249504 --user-agent "FooBarApp/3.0"
```

## General Information

**Your application must provide a User-Agent string that identifies itself** –
preferably something that follows [RFC\\
1945](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945#section-3.7). Some good examples
include:

```no-highlight
AwesomeDiscogsBrowser/0.1 +http://adb.example.com
LibraryMetadataEnhancer/0.3 +http://example.com/lime
MyDiscogsClient/1.0 +http://mydiscogsclient.org
```

Please don’t just copy one of those! Make it unique so we can let you know if
your application starts to misbehave – the alternative is that we just silently
block it, which will confuse and infuriate your users.

Here are some bad examples that are unclear or obscure the nature of the
application:

```no-highlight
curl/7.9.8 (i686-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl 7.9.8 (OpenSSL 0.9.6b)
Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:6.0.2) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/6.0.2
my app
```

### JSONP [¶](https://www.discogs.com/developers\#header-jsonp)

When a callback query string parameter is supplied, the API can
return responses in JSONP format.

JSONP, by its nature, cannot access HTTP information like headers or the status
code, so the API supplies that information in the response, like so:

```http
GET https://api.discogs.com/artists/1?callback=callbackname
```

```http
200 OK
Content-Type: text/javascript
```

```javascript
callbackname({
    "meta": {
        "status": 200,
    },
    "data": {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Persuader, The"
        // ... and so on
    }
})
```

* * *

## Rate Limiting

**Requests are throttled by the server by source IP to 60 per minute**
**for authenticated requests, and 25 per minute for unauthenticated requests,**
**with some exceptions.**

Your application should identify itself to our servers via a unique user agent
string in order to achieve the maximum number of requests per minute.

Our rate limiting tracks your requests using a moving average over a 60
second window. If no requests are made in 60 seconds, your window will reset.

We attach the following headers to responses to help you track your rate limit use:

`X-Discogs-Ratelimit`: The total number of requests you can make in a one
minute window.

`X-Discogs-Ratelimit-Used` : The number of requests you’ve made in your
existing rate limit window.

`X-Discogs-Ratelimit-Remaining`: The number of remaining requests you are
able to make in the existing rate limit window.

Your application should take our global limit into account and throttle
its requests locally.

In the future, we may update these rate limits at any time in order to
provide service for all users.

* * *

## Pagination

Some resources represent collections of objects and may be
paginated. By default, 50 items per page are shown.

To browse different pages, or change the number of items per page (up to 100),
use the page and per\_page query string parameters:

```http
GET https://api.discogs.com/artists/1/releases?page=2&per_page=75
```

Responses include a Link header:

```http
Link: <https://api.discogs.com/artists/1/releases?page=3&per_page=75>; rel=next,
<https://api.discogs.com/artists/1/releases?page=1&per_page=75>; rel=first,
<https://api.discogs.com/artists/1/releases?page=30&per_page=75>; rel=last,
<https://api.discogs.com/artists/1/releases?page=1&per_page=75>; rel=prev
```

And a pagination object in the response body:

```javascript
{
    "pagination": {
        "page": 2,
        "pages": 30,
        "items": 2255,
        "per_page": 75,
        "urls":
            {
                "first": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/1/releases?page=1&per_page=75",
                "prev": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/1/releases?page=1&per_page=75",
                "next": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/1/releases?page=3&per_page=75",
                "last": "https://api.discogs.com/artists/1/releases?page=30&per_page=75"
            }
    },
    "releases":
        [ ... ]
}
```

* * *

## Versioning and Media Types

Currently, our API only supports one version: v2. However, you can specify a version in your requests to future-proof your application. By adding an `Accept` header with the version and media type, you can guarantee your requests will receive data from the correct version you develop your app on.

A standard `Accept` header may look like this:

`application/vnd.discogs.v2.html+json`

If you are requesting information from an endpoint that may have text formatting in it, you can choose which kind of formatting you want to be returned by changing that section of the `Accept` header. We currently support 3 types:

`application/vnd.discogs.v2.html+json`

`application/vnd.discogs.v2.plaintext+json`

`application/vnd.discogs.v2.discogs+json`

If no Accept header is supplied, or if the Accept header differs from one of the three previous options, we default to `application/vnd.discogs.v2.discogs+json`.

## FAQ

1. **Why am I getting an empty response from the server?**

This generally happens when you forget to add a User-Agent header to your requests.

2. **How do I get updates about the API?**

Subscribe to our [API Announcements forum thread](https://www.discogs.com/forum/thread/521520689469733cfcfd2089). For larger, breaking changes, we will send out an email notice to all developers with a registered Discogs application.

3. **Where can I register a Discogs application?**

You can register a Discogs application on the [Developer Settings](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers).

4. **If I have a question/issue with the API, should I file a Support Request?**

It's generally best to start out with a forum post on the [API topic](https://www.discogs.com/forum/topic/1082) since other developers may have had similar issues and can point you in the right direction. If the issue requires privacy, then a support request is the best way to go.

5. **I'm getting a 404 response when trying to fetch images; what gives?**

This may seem obvious, but make sure you aren't doing anything to change the URL. The URLs returned are signed URLs, so trying to change one part of the URL (e.g., Release ID number) will generally not work.

6. **What are the authentication requirements for requesting images?**

Please see the [Images documentation page](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:images).

7. **Why am I getting a particular HTTP response?**
   - **200 OK**

     The request was successful, and the requested data is provided in the response body.

   - **201 Continue**

     You’ve sent a POST request to a list of resources to create a new one. The ID of
     the newly-created resource will be provided in the body of the response.

   - **204 No Content**

     The request was successful, and the server has no additional information to
     convey, so the response body is empty.

   - **401 Unauthorized**

     You’re attempting to access a resource that first requires [authentication](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:authentication). See
     Authenticating with OAuth.

   - **403 Forbidden**

     You’re not allowed to access this resource. Even if you authenticated, or
     already have, you simply don’t have permission. Trying to modify another user’s
     profile, for example, will produce this error.

   - **404 Not Found**

     The resource you requested doesn’t exist.

   - **405 Method Not Allowed**

     You’re trying to use an HTTP verb that isn’t supported by
     the resource. Trying to PUT to /artists/1, for example, will fail because
     Artists are read-only.

   - **422 Unprocessable Entity**

     Your request was well-formed, but there’s something
     semantically wrong with the body of the request. This can be due to malformed
     JSON, a parameter that’s missing or the wrong type, or trying to perform an
     action that doesn’t make any sense. Check the response body for specific
     information about what went wrong.

   - **500 Internal Server Error**

     Something went wrong on our end while attempting to
     process your request. The response body’s message field will contain an error
     code that you can send to Discogs Support (which will help us track down your
     specific issue).

# Authentication

This section describes the various methods of authenticating with the Discogs API.

* * *

## Registration [¶](https://www.discogs.com/developers\#header-registration-1)

In order to access protected endpoints, you’ll need to register for either a
consumer key and secret or user token, depending on your situation:

- To easily access your own user account information, use a **User token**.

- To get access to an endpoint that requires authentication and build 3rd party apps, use a **Consumer Key and Secret**.


To get one of these, sign up for a Discogs account if you don’t have one
already, and go to your [Developer Settings](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers).
From there, you can create a new application/token or edit the metadata for an existing app.

When you create a new application, you’ll be granted a **Consumer Key** and
**Consumer Secret**, which you can plug into your application and start making
authenticated requests. It’s important that you don’t disclose the Consumer Secret to
anyone.

Generating a user token is as easy as clicking the **Generate token** button on
the developer settings. Keep this token private, as it allows users to access
your information.

* * *

## OAuth Endpoints [¶](https://www.discogs.com/developers\#header-oauth-endpoints-1)

The OAuth 1.0a flow involves three server-side endpoints:

Request token URL: `https://api.discogs.com/oauth/request_token`

Authorize URL: `https://www.discogs.com/oauth/authorize`

Access token URL: `https://api.discogs.com/oauth/access_token`

For convenience, these are also listed on the Edit Application page.

Once authenticated, you can test that everything’s working correctly by
requesting the [Identity](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:user-identity,header:user-identity-identity)
resource.

* * *

## Discogs Auth Flow

If you do not plan on building an app which others can log into on their
behalf, you should use this authentication method as it is much simpler and
is still secure. Discogs Auth requires that requests be made over HTTPS, as you are
sending your app’s key/secret or token in the request.

To send requests with Discogs Auth, you have two options: sending your
credentials in the query string with `key` and `secret` parameters or a `token` parameter, for example:

```http
curl "https://api.discogs.com/database/search?q=Nirvana&key=foo123&secret=bar456"
```

or

```http
curl "https://api.discogs.com/database/search?q=Nirvana&token=abcxyz123456"
```

Your other option is to send your credentials in the request as an `Authorization` header, as follows:

```http
curl "https://api.discogs.com/database/search?q=Nirvana" -H "Authorization: Discogs key=foo123, secret=bar456"
```

or

```http
curl "https://api.discogs.com/database/search?q=Nirvana" -H "Authorization: Discogs token=abcxyz123456"
```

What differentiates the `key`/ `secret` pair option from the `token` option?
Let’s look at this table:

| Credentials in request | Rate limiting? | Image URLs? | Authenticated as user? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | 🐢 Low tier | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| Only Consumer key/secret | 🐰 High tier | ✔️ Yes | ❌ No |
| Full OAuth 1.0a with access token/secret ( [see below](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:authentication,header:authentication-oauth-flow)) | 🐰 High tier | ✔️ Yes | ✔️ Yes, on behalf of any user 🌍 |
| Personal access token | 🐰 High tier | ✔️ Yes | ✔️ Yes, for token holder only 👩 |

In other words:

- Using the `key` and `secret` will get you [image](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:images) URLs. These
are unavailable to unauthenticated requests.

- Using the `key` and `secret` will up your
[rate limit](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:home,header:home-rate-limiting), unlike unauthenticated
requests.

- **BUT** using the `key` and `secret` does **not** identify the requester as
any particular user, and as such will **not** grant access to any resources
users should be able to see on their own account (e.g. marketplace orders,
private inventory fields, private collections). You will need to use either
of the `token` options for these resources.


That’s it! Continue sending the key/secret pair or user token with the rest of your requests.

* * *

## OAuth Flow

OAuth is a protocol that allows users to grant access to their data without
having to share their password.

This is an explanation of how a web application may work with Discogs using
OAuth 1.0a. We highly suggest you use an [OAuth library/wrapper](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:home,header:home-quickstart) to simplify the
process of authenticating.

1\. Obtain consumer key and consumer secret from Developer Settings [¶](https://www.discogs.com/developers#header-1.-obtain-consumer-key-and-consumer-secret-from-developer-settings)

Application registration can be found here:
[https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers](https://www.discogs.com/settings/developers)

You only need to register once per application you make. You should not share
your consumer secret, as it acts as a sort of password for your requests.

2\. Send a GET request to the Discogs request token URL [¶](https://www.discogs.com/developers#header-2.-send-a-get-request-to-the-discogs-request-token-url)

```http
GET https://api.discogs.com/oauth/request_token
```

Include the following headers with your request:

```http
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization:
        OAuth oauth_consumer_key="your_consumer_key",
        oauth_nonce="random_string_or_timestamp",
        oauth_signature="your_consumer_secret&",
        oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT",
        oauth_timestamp="current_timestamp",
        oauth_callback="your_callback"
User-Agent: some_user_agent
```

**Note:** using an OAuth library instead of generating these requests manually
will likely save you a headache if you are new to OAuth. Please refer to your
OAuth library’s documentation if you choose to do so.

As the example shows, we suggest sending requests with HTTPS and the PLAINTEXT
signature method over HMAC-SHA1 due to its simple yet secure nature. This
involves setting your oauth\_signature\_method to “PLAINTEXT” and your
oauth\_signature to be your consumer secret followed by an ampersand (&).

If all goes well with the request, you should get an `HTTP 200 OK` response.
If an invalid OAuth request is sent, you will receive an `HTTP 400 Bad Request` response.

Be sure to include a unique User-Agent in the request headers.

A successful request will return a response that contains the following content:
OAuth request token ( `oauth_token`), an OAuth request token secret
( `oauth_token_secret`), and a callback confirmation
( `oauth_callback_confirmed`). These will be used in the following steps.

3\. Redirect your user to the Discogs Authorize page [¶](https://www.discogs.com/developers#header-3.-redirect-your-user-to-the-discogs-authorize-page)

Authorization page:

```http
https://discogs.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=<your_oauth_request_token>
```

This page will ask the user to authorize your app on behalf of their Discogs
account. If they accept and authorize, they will receive a verifier key to use
as verification. This key is used in the next phase of OAuth authentication.

If you added a callback URL to your Discogs application registration, the user
will be redirected to that URL, and you can capture their verifier from the
response. The verifier will be used to generate the access token in the next
step. You can always edit your application settings to include a callback URL
(i.e., you don’t need to re-create a new application).

4\. Send a POST request to the Discogs access token URL [¶](https://www.discogs.com/developers#header-4.-send-a-post-request-to-the-discogs-access-token-url)

```http
POST https://api.discogs.com/oauth/access_token
```

Include the following headers in your request:

```http
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization:
        OAuth oauth_consumer_key="your_consumer_key",
        oauth_nonce="random_string_or_timestamp",
        oauth_token="oauth_token_received_from_step_2"
        oauth_signature="your_consumer_secret&",
        oauth_signature_method="PLAINTEXT",
        oauth_timestamp="current_timestamp",
        oauth_verifier="users_verifier"
User-Agent: some_user_agent
```

If the OAuth access token is not created within 15 minutes of when you receive
the OAuth request token, your OAuth request token and verifier will expire, and
you will need to re-create them. If you try to POST to the access token URL with
an expired verifier or your request is malformed, you will receive an HTTP 400
Bad Request response.

As the example shows, we suggest sending requests with HTTPS and the PLAINTEXT
signature method over HMAC-SHA1 due to its simple yet secure nature. This
involves setting your oauth\_signature\_method to “PLAINTEXT” and your
oauth\_signature to be your consumer secret followed by an ampersand (&).

Be sure to include a unique User-Agent in the header.

A successful request will return a response that contains an OAuth access token
( `oauth_token`) and an OAuth access token secret ( `oauth_token_secret`). These
tokens do not expire (unless the user revokes access from your app), so you
should store these tokens in a database or persistent storage to make future
requests signed with OAuth. All requests that require OAuth will require these
two tokens to be sent in the request.

5\. Send authenticated requests to Discogs endpoints [¶](https://www.discogs.com/developers#header-5.-send-authenticated-requests-to-discogs-endpoints)

You are now ready to send authenticated requests with Discogs through OAuth. Be
sure to attach the user’s OAuth access token and OAuth access token secret to
each request.

To test that you are ready to send authenticated requests, send a GET request to
the identity URL. A successful request will yield a response that contains
information about the authenticated user.

```http
GET https://api.discogs.com/oauth/identity
```

## Videos

If your application integrates YouTube videos, then third party cookies may be used. You can view YouTube and Google’s cookie policy [here](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/cookies/).

# Images

The Image resource represents a user-contributed image of a database object,
such as Artists or Releases. Image requests require [authentication](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:authentication) and are
subject to rate limiting.

It’s unlikely that you’ll ever have to construct an image URL; images keys on
other resources use fully-qualified URLs, including hostname and protocol. To
retrieve images, authenticate via OAuth or Discogs Auth and fetch the object
that contains the image of interest (e.g., the release, user profile, etc.). The
image URL will be in the response using the HTTPS protocol, and requesting that
URL should succeed.

# Marketplace

## Inventory

Returns the list of listings in a user’s inventory. Accepts [Pagination parameters](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:home,header:home-pagination).

Basic information about each listing and the corresponding release is provided, suitable for display in a list. For detailed information about the release, make another API call to fetch the corresponding Release.

If you are not authenticated as the inventory owner, only items that have a status of For Sale will be visible.

If you are authenticated as the inventory owner you will get additional `weight`, `format_quantity`, `external_id`, `location`, and `quantity` keys. Note that `quantity` is a read-only field for NearMint users, who will see `1` for all quantity values, regardless of their actual count.
If the user is authorized, the listing will contain a in\_cart boolean field indicating whether or not this listing is in their cart.

Get inventory

[GET](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:marketplace,header:marketplace-inventory-get)

Edit An Order

[POST](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:marketplace,header:marketplace-order-post)

`/marketplace/orders/{order_id}`

Edit the data associated with an order.

[Authentication](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:authentication) as the seller is required.

The response contains a `next_status` key – an array of valid next statuses for this order, which you can display to the user in (for example) a dropdown control. This also renders your application more resilient to any future changes in the order status logic.

Changing the order status using this resource will always message the buyer with:

`Seller changed status from Old Status to New Status`

and does not provide a facility for including a custom message along with the change. For more fine-grained control, use the Add a new message resource, which allows you to simultaneously add a message and change the order status.

If the order status is neither cancelled, Payment Received, nor Shipped, you can change the shipping. Doing so will send an invoice to the buyer and set the order status to Invoice Sent. (For that reason, you cannot set the shipping and the order status in the same request.)

- **Parameters**
- order\_id`number`(required)**Example:** 1-1

The ID of the order you are fetching

status`string`(optional)**Example:** New Order

The status of the Order you are updating. Must be one of the following:

`New Order`

`Buyer Contacted`

`Invoice Sent`

`Payment Pending`

`Payment Received` `In Progress` `Shipped`

`Refund Sent`

`Cancelled (Non-Paying Buyer)`

`Cancelled (Item Unavailable)`

`Cancelled (Per Buyer's Request)`


the order’s current status



Furthermore, the new status must be present in the order’s next\_status list. For more information about order statuses, see Edit an order.

shipping`number`(optional)**Example:** 5.00

The order shipping amount. As a side-effect of setting this value, the buyer is invoiced and the order status is set to `Invoice Sent`.

# User Collection

## Collection

The Collection resource allows you to view and manage a user’s collection.

A collection is arranged into folders. Every user has two permanent folders already:

ID `0`, the “All” folder, which cannot have releases added to it, and

ID `1`, the “Uncategorized” folder.

Because it’s possible to own more than one copy of a release, each with its own notes, grading, and so on, each instance of a release in a folder has an instance ID.

Through the Discogs website, users can create custom notes fields. There is not yet an API method for creating and deleting these fields, but they can be listed, and the values of the fields on any instance can be modified.

Get Collection Folders

[GET](https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:user-collection,header:user-collection-collection-get)

`/users/{username}/collection/folders`

If you are not authenticated as the collection owner, only folder ID 0 (the “All” folder) will be visible (if the requested user’s collection is public).
